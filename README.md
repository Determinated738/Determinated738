**I’m a self-taught researcher focused on the Microsoft gaming ecosystem. My work mixes low-level binary exploitation with high-performance graphics programming.**

### Focus Areas

*   **Reverse Engineering:** ARM / x64 assembly, network proxying, and undocumented file formats.
*   **Targets:** Minecraft (International & Chinese editions), Xbox Live, PlayFab, MS Store.
*   **Development:** Three.JS, Discord bots, and GPU-based rendering.

### Selected Work

**Graphics Engineering**
*   **Vertex Animation Textures (VAT):** Wrote a custom VAT system to handle massive amounts of skinned mesh animations entirely on the GPU.
*   **Particle Engine:** Built a standalone 3D particle system from the ground up, with support for ribbon trails.
*   **Rendering Engine:** Developing a native Node.js 3D renderer on top of Three.JS.

**Reverse Engineering**
*   **Asset Formats:** Decoded proprietary geometry, particle, and animation formats for Minecraft (both Global and NetEase/China versions).
*   **Binary Analysis:** Digging into game logic on ARM and x86_64 architectures.
*   **Automation:** Created "Marketplace Bot," an automation tool built by reverse-engineering the private Xbox and PlayFab APIs.
